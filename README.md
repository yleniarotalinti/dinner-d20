🍽️ Dinner Decision Helper
Tired of the eternal struggle of deciding what to eat for dinner after climbing at 11pm? 
Marco and Ylenia sure are! 

📝 How It Works
- Loads Recipes & Ingredients from an Excel file (recipes_data.xlsx).
- Avoids Marco’s Disliked Ingredients (stored in the "Disliked" sheet).
- Suggests a Dinner based on available time.
- Logs the Meal Choice along with the date and where they ate.
